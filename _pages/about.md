I have been serving as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Hong Kong Baptist University since Fall 2017, focusing my research on statistical machine learning, deep learning theory, and their applications. Previously, I worked as a research associate under the mentorship of Professor Ming Yuan in the Department of Statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison.
